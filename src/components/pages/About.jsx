   <p>Hi,
   In this assignment I tried to create a Book Website Clone using React. I used an API that does not require authentication.
I planned to take data from API and create a responsive website where all products can be seen. Details of products can be viewed and books can be searched by name.

   </p>
   <p>I used React / React Router Dom / Bootstrap </p>

  </div>
  </>
  }
  
  export default About;
