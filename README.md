# React-Public-Api

Hi, In this assignment I tried to create a Book Website Clone using React. I used an API that does not require authentication. I planned to take data from API and create a responsive website where all products can be seen. Details of products can be viewed and books can be searched by name.

I used React / React Router Dom / Bootstrap
